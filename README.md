Three simple rules are followed:

- Only one disk can be moved at a time.
- Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack. In other words, a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.
- No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
